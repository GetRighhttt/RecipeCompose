## **Recipe Compose**

## **Introduction**
This app uses `TheMealDB`, `YelpFusion`, and `Google Maps` APIs to allow users to find recipes. I have leveraged most of the Jetpack Components to create this application and further explore Jetpack Compose. A user can save their favorite meals, visit the source of the meals, watch how to prepare the meals on YouTube, search for businesses in the area, and more. I also added Firebase for authentication, firestore, analytics, and performance metrics. I also monitor network connectivity in the application and handle permissions. I tracked my progress and created issues similar to a regular workflow to show progression. I'm looking to add more progressively so I'm open to collaboration.
